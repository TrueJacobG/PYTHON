TODO:
colors in func for example -> printc("dudu", color="red") <- warning etc
without mypy arrows etc in file support
class tests
test file on import


DOCS?:
do mypy then testing_tool


DONE:
python3 testingtool.py file.py

test file types -> str, int, float, bool
expectations file name -> like a file, but with .test

test file example
square;int;int;int
# func name ;arg1 type; arg2 type; result1 type
1,2;2
1,3;3
2,3;6
# arg1,arg2;result1

test if files exist's

option live to see which case passing
-live 
if something wrong then it stops testing
else write good results

YOU CAN'T USE WORD 'def' IN YOUR FILE(in comments or in strings)

in .py.test in strings you can't use ";" and "," 

checking if types in .py are equal to .py.test

do mypy before testing

check if inputs in .py.test are correct type

test if .py.test file exist



COLORS:
red -> error
green -> ok
blue -> types are correct
yellow -> warning, problem with testing_tool
